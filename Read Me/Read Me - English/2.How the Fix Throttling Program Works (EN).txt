============================== Fix Throttling ================== ==============
Have you read the file 'Throttling Problems'?
Here I will explain how to work on the program that I created.

If you are a Windows 10 user, surely you know Power Options (the taskbar has a battery logo, just right click)
or you can open it via Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Power Options.
generally there is only 'plan Balanced (Recommmend)'.
when this program is run, the program will switch to 'Power Saver' mode (You can see in "Create a power plan")
and will return to Balanced mode within 1 second automatically.

well, the program I created within 10 minutes will always change the Battery mode
from 'Balanced' to 'Power Saver' mode and back to 'Balanced' mode again.

why do it like that?
it's like walking around on a bicycle without a break and then the tire on the bike will burst by itself.
and this program will fix the tire on the punctured bicycle automatically without the need to stop cycling or continue cycling.

then, what are the side effects of this program?

side effects :
1. if you play the game, the FPS will drop a few seconds (usually 1-5 seconds)
2. Brightness on the laptop will go up and down automatically (that's because if you haven't set Brightness in 'Power Saver' mode)


Notes :
If this program is successful in overcoming Throttling on your Laptop,
please don't forget to rest your laptop as well as yourself.
